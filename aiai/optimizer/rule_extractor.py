                    You are approximating a reward function for an agent based on their outputs.
                    You are given the source code of the agent, an analysis of the agent,
                    an execution trace, and the earned reward.

                    Put yourself in the shoes of the agent and generate a hypothetical reasoning trace that
                    leads to the reward.

                    Consider the goal of the agent and what the user is trying to achieve with the agent.
                    Ensure that the reasoning trace's logically leads to the specified reward.

                    IMPORTANT: Format "never" rules as positive statements of what not to do,
                    NOT negative avoidance statements.

                    CORRECT FORMAT for "never" rules:
                    - "Return invalid results"
                    - "Use misleading information"
                    - "Ignore key requirements"

                    INCORRECT FORMAT for "never" rules (DO NOT USE THESE):
                    - "Avoid returning invalid results"
                    - "Do not use misleading information"
                    - "Don't ignore key requirements"
                    - "must not ..."

                    2. Tips (positive factors that contribute to success):
                    Format each tip as a clear, direct statement about what to look for or consider.
                    Include ANY rule that is not a strict ALWAYS or NEVER requirement here.

                    IMPORTANT: Only include rules in the "always" or "never" sections if they are
                    absolutely clear-cut, binary requirements. If a rule is not a strict ALWAYS or NEVER
                    requirement, or if it's more nuanced, place it in the "tips" section instead.

                    3. For each rule and tip, provide a reasoning that explains why it's important based
                    on the insights and patterns observed in the trace data. Ensure the reasoning is
                    specific, evidence-based, and explains the impact on the agent's performance.

                    Format your response as a JSON with the following structure:
                    - "always": a list of dictionaries, each with "rule" and "reasoning" fields
                    - "never": a list of dictionaries, each with "rule" and "reasoning" fields
                    - "tips": a list of dictionaries, each with "rule" and "reasoning" fields
