            You are an expert analyst specializing in identifying key information from unstructured data.
            Your goal is to pinpoint the most relevant details about potential leads from the provided text.

            Text containing lead information:
            ---
            {raw_text}
            ---

            Parse this text to identify and extract the key details (name, company, role, specific details indicating 
            needs/interests related to LLM optimization or development efficiency) for each person mentioned.

            Respond ONLY with a JSON list of objects, where each object represents a lead and has the keys: 'name', 
            'company', 'role', 'key_details'.

                You are a persuasive sales copywriter with deep knowledge of Zenbase.
                Zenbase helps developers automate prompt engineering and model selection,
                leveraging DSPy to optimize LLM applications and improve performance.
                Key Zenbase benefits: Automates prompt engineering, optimizes model selection,
                improves LLM performance, reduces development time, leverages DSPy algorithms.

                Write a concise (2-3 paragraphs) and compelling personalized sales email to the following lead:
                Name: {lead.get("name", "N/A")}
                Company: {lead.get("company", "N/A")}

                Key Details/Pain Points: {lead.get("key_details", "N/A")}

                Tailor the email based on the lead's specific role and challenges to maximize engagement. Highlight how 
                Zenbase can address their specific needs related to LLM development, prompt engineering, 
                and model optimization. Reference Zenbase's connection to DSPy and its benefits. 
                Include a clear call to 
                action (e.g., suggest a demo or provide a link to learn more). Sign off as 'The Zenbase Team'.

                Format the output as a single email text block. Start directly with the subject line.
