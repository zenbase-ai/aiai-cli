# About AIAI CLI

## Project Overview

AIAI CLI (AI Agent Improvement CLI) is an open-source tool designed to optimize AI agents through automated analysis and rule extraction. It helps developers identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement in their agent code.

## Key Features

- **Automated Code Analysis**: Analyze agent code to understand its structure and dependencies
- **Execution Tracing**: Capture detailed traces of agent execution for analysis
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create diverse test cases to thoroughly exercise agents
- **Rule Extraction**: Identify patterns and extract optimization rules from execution data
- **Rule Localization**: Map rules to specific locations in source code
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with actionable recommendations

## Project History

AIAI CLI was developed by the Zenbase team to address the growing need for optimization tools in the AI agent ecosystem. As AI agents became more complex and widely used, the need for systematic optimization approaches became apparent.

The project builds on research in program analysis, performance optimization, and AI systems to create a practical tool for agent developers.

## Research Foundation

The theoretical foundation of AIAI CLI is documented in the [Rule Extractor Paper](https://github.com/zenbase/rule-extractor-paper), which describes the methodology and algorithms used for rule extraction and optimization.

Key research contributions include:

- Novel techniques for analyzing AI agent execution traces
- Methods for extracting optimization rules from execution patterns
- Approaches for mapping abstract rules to concrete code locations
- Evaluation frameworks for measuring optimization effectiveness

## License

AIAI CLI is released under the MIT License, making it freely available for use, modification, and distribution.

## Team

AIAI CLI is developed and maintained by the Zenbase team, a group of researchers and engineers focused on advancing AI agent technology.
