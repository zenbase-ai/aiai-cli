# Agent Optimization

Agent optimization is the core purpose of AIAI CLI. This page explains what agent optimization is and how AIAI CLI approaches it.

## What is Agent Optimization?

Agent optimization is the process of improving an AI agent's performance, efficiency, reliability, and overall effectiveness. It involves identifying bottlenecks, inefficient patterns, and opportunities for improvement in the agent's code and execution.

## Why Optimize Agents?

AI agents, especially those built with large language models (LLMs), can benefit from optimization for several reasons:

- **Cost Reduction**: Optimized agents make fewer and more efficient API calls, reducing operational costs.
- **Latency Improvement**: Optimized agents respond more quickly to user requests.
- **Reliability**: Optimized agents handle edge cases and errors more effectively.
- **Scalability**: Optimized agents can handle more concurrent users or requests.

## AIAI CLI's Approach to Optimization

AIAI CLI takes a data-driven approach to agent optimization:

1. **Code Analysis**: First, AIAI CLI analyzes the agent's source code to understand its structure, dependencies, and components.
2. **Execution Tracing**: The agent is run multiple times with different inputs to collect execution traces.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: AIAI CLI analyzes the traces to identify patterns, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies.
4. **Rule Extraction**: Patterns are converted into explicit optimization rules.
5. **Rule Localization**: Rules are mapped to specific locations in the source code.
6. **Report Generation**: A comprehensive report is generated with recommendations for optimization.

## Types of Optimizations

AIAI CLI can identify various types of optimizations:

### Functional Optimizations

These optimizations improve how the agent accomplishes its tasks:

- Eliminating redundant API calls
- Caching results of expensive operations
- Parallelizing independent operations
- Implementing retries for unreliable operations

### Cost Optimizations

These optimizations reduce the operational cost of running the agent:

- Reducing the number of LLM API calls
- Minimizing token usage in prompts and responses
- Using cheaper models for simpler tasks
- Batching similar operations

### Reliability Optimizations

These optimizations improve the agent's ability to handle errors and edge cases:

- Adding robust error handling
- Implementing fallback strategies
- Validating inputs and outputs
- Adding monitoring and logging

## Measuring Optimization Success

The success of optimization efforts can be measured in several ways:

- **Execution Time**: How much faster does the agent complete its tasks?
- **Cost**: How much less does it cost to run the agent?
- **Success Rate**: How much more reliable is the agent?
- **Resource Usage**: How much less memory, CPU, or network bandwidth does the agent use?

## Applying Optimizations

After AIAI CLI generates optimization recommendations, it's up to you to apply them to your agent's code. The recommendations are designed to be actionable and include:

- Where to make changes (file paths and code sections)
- What changes to make (specific recommendations)
- Why to make the changes (rationale and expected benefits)
- Confidence in the recommendation (how strongly the data supports it)
