# Optimizing Your Own Agent

This guide walks through the process of optimizing your own AI agent using the AIAI CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before optimizing your own agent, make sure you have:

1. AIAI CLI installed
2. Your OpenAI API key set in your environment:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key
   ```
3. A Python agent with a proper entrypoint file

## Preparing Your Agent

AIAI CLI requires an entrypoint file that contains a `main()` function. This function should:

1. Accept an input example parameter
2. Run your agent with that input
3. Return the agent's raw output

Here's an example of a properly structured entrypoint file:

```python
def main(example=None):
    crew = get_crewai_agent()
    example = example or "default example"
    result = crew.kickoff({"input": example})
    return result.raw
```

Save this file in your project directory. It will be the starting point for the optimization process.

## Running the Optimization

Start the optimization process by running:

```bash
aiai
```

You'll see the following output and prompts:

```
üöÄ Welcome to aiai! ü§ñ

What would you like to optimize?
(1) Outbound email agent (Demo)
(2) My own agent
Enter your choice (1 or 2):
```

Select option 2, and you'll be prompted for your agent's entrypoint:

```
To optimize your own agent, we need an entrypoint.py file.
This file must have a `def main(example=None)` function that
runs your agent with the provided example.

Path to entrypoint:
```

Enter the full path to your entrypoint file (e.g., `/path/to/your/agent.py`).

After providing the path, the optimization process begins:

```

## Understanding the Optimization Report

The optimization report contains specific rules categorized as:

1. **ALWAYS** - Critical rules that should always be followed
2. **NEVER** - Anti-patterns to avoid in your agent
3. **TIPS** - Best practices to improve agent performance

Each rule includes the file path and line number where it should be applied.

Here's an example of what the report might look like:

```markdown
# /path/to/your/agent.py

ALWAYS
Validate user input before processing
/path/to/your/agent.py:28
---
NEVER
Ignore error conditions from API calls
/path/to/your/agent.py:42
---
TIPS
Structure your response with clear sections for better readability
/path/to/your/agent.py:65
---
...
```

## Applying the Optimizations

To apply the optimization rules, simply add them to your agent's prompt. This helps guide the language model to follow best practices and produce better outputs.

To implement the optimization insights in your prompts, you can use this XML-like format:

```
<rules>
    <always>
        1. Reference at least one lead-specific pain point in the body of the email
    </always>
    <never>
        1. Return emails that lack a distinct, actionable call to action as the closing statement
    </never>
</rules>

<tips>
    1. Structure your response with clear sections for better readability
</tips>
```

### Example: Before and After

**Before optimization:**

```python
def get_email_prompt(lead_info):
    prompt = f"""
    Create a sales email for {lead_info['name']} at {lead_info['company']}.
    Their role is {lead_info['role']} and they are interested in {lead_info['interests']}.
    
    Make the email persuasive and highlight our product features.
    """
    return prompt
```

**After applying optimization rules:**

```python
def get_email_prompt(lead_info):
    prompt = f"""
    Create a sales email for {lead_info['name']} at {lead_info['company']}.
    Their role is {lead_info['role']} and they are interested in {lead_info['interests']}.
    
    <rules>
        <always>
            1. Limit the email to 2-3 concise paragraphs
            2. Include a clear call to action in the final paragraph
        </always>
        <never>
            1. Exceed the 2-3 paragraph limit
            2. Return multiple emails per input lead
        </never>
    </rules>
    
    <tips>
        1. Craft a concise, professional tone tailored to the recipient's industry
        2. Map product features directly to the recipient's specific pain points
        3. Personalize the subject line to reflect the lead's company and challenge
    </tips>
    """
    return prompt
```

By adding these rules to your prompt, you help the model understand exactly what to do and what to avoid, resulting in more consistent and effective outputs.

## Advanced Configuration

For more advanced optimization scenarios, AIAI CLI offers various command-line options to customize the optimization process. 

See the [Configuration Reference](../user-guide/configuration-reference.md) for a complete list of available options, including:

- Model selection for different pipeline components
- Synthetic data generation settings
- Performance tuning options
